🔍 Overview
This project dives deep into Uber ride data to:

Understand trends and patterns. 📈
Clean and prepare raw datasets. 🧹
Create insightful visualizations. 🖼️
Derive actionable insights for decision-making. 💡

🛠️ Process
1️⃣ Data Understanding
📜 Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes columns like START_DATE, CATEGORY, PURPOSE, MILES, etc.

Key Steps:

Analyzed dataset structure and statistics.
Identified missing or inconsistent values.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
🧹 Steps Taken:

Formatted date columns (START_DATE).
Filled missing values in PURPOSE and handled outliers.
Extracted new features:
🗓️ Day of the Week (DAY_OF_WEEK)
⏰ Hour of the ride (HOUR)

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔍 Key Insights Uncovered:

Patterns and distributions across categories, purposes, and distances.
Visualized data trends with histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots.

4️⃣ Time-Based Analysis
⏳ Visualizations:

📊 Heatmap: Ride frequency by hour and day of the week.
🌟 Radar Chart: Average miles traveled across days.
➕ Cumulative Sum Plot: Total distance over time.
📝 Insight: Peak activity during weekday mornings and evenings, corresponding to work commutes.

5️⃣ Category and Purpose Analysis
📂 Visualizations:

📈 Countplot: CATEGORY distribution (e.g., Business vs. Personal).
🖼️ Word Cloud: Frequent trip purposes like "Meeting" and "Meal/Entertain."
📊 Stacked Bar Chart: Comparing CATEGORY and PURPOSE.
📝 Insight: Business trips dominate the dataset, with “Meal/Entertain” prevalent in personal rides.

6️⃣ Distance-Based Analysis
🛣️ Visualizations:

📊 Histogram: Distribution of trip distances.
📈 Boxplot: Distance variability by category.
🗺️ Heatmap: Distance frequency by time of day.
📝 Insight: Personal trips tend to cover shorter distances, while business rides vary widely.

🧰 Technologies Used
Language: Python 🐍
Libraries:
📦 Pandas: Data manipulation
📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization
🌟 Plotly: Interactive visualizations
☁️ WordCloud: Purpose word clouds

🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to transform raw data into meaningful insights using data visualization and analysis. From understanding travel patterns to identifying key business trends, the Uber Ride Analysis provides a comprehensive overview of ride-sharing dynamics.
